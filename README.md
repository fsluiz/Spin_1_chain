# Calculate a two bodies correlation for a Spin-1 models

This code written in python calculates the correlation of two bodies for the models Spin-1 Bilinear Biquadratic Chain, Spin-1 XXZ Chains with Uniaxial Single-Ion-Type Anisotropy or Spins-1 Bond-Alternating XXZ Chains.At each step of the evolution of the Hamiltonian, it saves the correlations in hdf5 files, at the end it joins all the files in a single dataframe.
